EchoPiBox 2.0 Passive Acoustic Monitor: Detection and Species Identification Accuracy.
MSc Connected Environments Dissertation by Margarita Smoldareva

Research Question:
Can Raspberry Pi 4 host open-source machine learning algorithm and three additional sensors to classify social bat calls and environmental variables in real time using Flutter App? 

UK bats and their importance 
Bat, being the sole flying mammal of the world is the most diverse specie on Earth. Except for Antarctica, they are found on every continent. In the United Kingdom, 17 different breeds of bat along with some vagrant visitors are found (Entwhistle et al., 2001). Bats are important creatures whose ecological roles as predator and prey have been postulated to regulate environmental and economic services including nutrient distribution, arthropod suppression, pollination, and biodiversity. For the purpose of foraging and roosting, the utilization of different habitats by bats regulates nutrient dispersion and soil fertility to facilitate dietary transfer within ecosystems from nutrient-rich locations to poor-nutrient regions (Buchler, 1975). Furthermore, bats serve as exceptional ecological indicators of habitat quality. Due to their mobility, ecological distribution, population trends, taxonomic stability, size, global distribution, and longevity, bats have great potential as bioindicators for contaminants and disturbance in the atmosphere (Kasso and Balakrishnan, 2013, 4). 

Similarly, tropical bats provide immense support as pollinators to national and local economies. The role of bats as a bioindicator taxa is highly essential to evaluate climatic responses, loss of habitat, and insectsâ€™ population in a particular region enabling the researchers to reflect on forthcoming impacts and wider-scale changes on biodiversity.  

Despite being an essential contributor to the environment and nature, bat populations have drastically declined in the United Kingdom. Due to a lack of substantial historical data on bat distribution and population sizes, it is hard to quantify the population decline. However, some common issues for bats' survival include poor management of their feeding habitats, roost sites, and lack of protection of hibernation sites (hibernacula) (Entwhistle, 7). Thus, the population of British bats has shrunk notably and species conservation techniques and interventions are being studied and implemented to meet their habitat requirements (Hill and Greenaway, 2008).

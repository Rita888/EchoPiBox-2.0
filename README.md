EchoPiBox 2.0 Passive Acoustic Monitor: Detection, Species Identification Accuracy and Dispalying Real Time Data.

MSc Connected Environments Dissertation by Margarita Smoldareva

Research Question:
Can Raspberry Pi 4 host open-source machine learning algorithm and three additional sensors to classify social bat calls and environmental variables in real time using Flutter App? 

Aim: Detect - Build a physical device (EchoPiBox 2.0) which allows bat calls detection. 
Objective: Set up Raspberry Pi 4, Ultramic, Temperature/Humidity and GPS Sensors to record environmental variables and bat calls. 

Aim: Classify - Deploy Machine Learning Algorithm on EchoPiBox 2.0 and test its accuracy. 
Objective: Select and deploy the device across five sites based in England and Wales to test accuracy of classification of bat calls. 

Aim: Exhibit - Display the Real Time Data
Objective: Using Flutter App display data collected by EchoPiBox 2.0 when deployed at any time.
